## Raspberry_Pi_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

I worked with Gaby to code a 10 second countdown on Python that tells you to launch when the count ends. This will be useful for our final project.

### Code

``` python
import time
for x in range (10,0,-1):  #counting range for timer
    print(x)
    time.sleep (1)  #rest 1 sec between each number
print("LAUNCHY")   #say dis

```


### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
